<h1>KADATH</h1>
<p>A multiplayer game engine.</p>
<p>KADATH is a project for developing a multiplayer game engine. The client and the server code are being released under the GPL.</p>
<p>The client side of the engine was being developed under OGRE (check <a href="http://www.ngranek.com">ngranek.com</a> and <a href="http://bigjocker.unplug.org.ve">my blog (in spanish)</a> for
further information on the previous versions), but a bug in the ATI drivers for Linux and a problem with
the PagingLandscape plugin have halted the development of that version (we may restart in the future). This version
uses the impressive jME engine.</p>
<p>Right now we are porting everything from the OGRE version to this version, so a lot of changes and refactoring
is going to take place.</p>
